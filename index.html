                        <li>Online security is up to date and in compliance with HIPAA and VA standards (Veteran Affairs, 2013).</li>
                        <li>As part of completing the welcome module, participants must complete the introduction process that reviews and requires electronic signature of informed consent for acknowledging webSTAIR’s group confidentiality agreement that outlines the group purpose, behavioral expectations,  and limits of confidentiality (Roddy et al., 2024).</li>
                        <li>Trauma-informed group facilitators monitor for emotional distress and follow crisis protocols and referrals, as needed. Additionally, group meetings formally address informed consent and confidentiality as part of the introduction each live session.</li>
