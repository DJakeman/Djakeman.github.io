                    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Online security is up to date and in compliance with HIPAA and VA standards (Veteran Affairs, 2013).</li>
                        <li>As part of completing the welcome module, participants must complete the introduction process that reviews and requires electronic signature of informed consent for acknowledging webSTAIR’s group confidentiality agreement that outlines the group purpose, behavioral expectations,  and limits of confidentiality (Roddy et al., 2024).</li>
                        <li>Trauma-informed group facilitators monitor for emotional distress and follow crisis protocols and referrals, as needed. Additionally, group meetings formally address informed consent and confidentiality as part of the introduction each live session.</li>

                    <h2>Theoretical Approach</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The webSTAIR program is a psychoeducational support group that operates from a transdiagnostic, integrative approach that implements a mixture of research backed strategies to educate clients, enhance coping skills and increase emotional awareness and regulation (Kim et al., 2024).</li>
                        <li>The STAIR acronym stands for “Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation”, simply meaning this is a skills-focused psychoeducational support group (Veteran Affairs, 2013).</li>
                        <li>Incorporates trauma-informed CBT-based practices that are client-centered, such as motivational interviewing, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, exposure (ie writing about traumatic a event or discussing in small groups), and mindfulness and relaxation techniques (Roddy et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024).</li>
